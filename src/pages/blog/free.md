I recently started giving away stuff, usually baby stuff, for free on Facebook Marketplace. We don't need them and I'm happy to give them away and reduce waste as much as I can. 

These items are usual pretty cheap ranging from $10 to $30. The moment I publish them for free, I immediately receive requests and the item is given away within a day or so. I've had folks driving for half an hour to pick up a bread knife that costs $13 on Amazon. It barely breaks even with the cost of th drive. 

The psychology of free is known and documented in many research paper, but it's still remarkable to see that in real life.

Note: Facebook Marketplace is pretty awesome! I'm surprised anyone is still using Craigslist...
