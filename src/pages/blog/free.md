I recently started giving away stuff, usually baby stuff, for free on Facebook Marketplace. We don't need them and I'm happy to give them away and reduce waste as much as I can. 

These items are usual pretty cheap ranging from $10 to $30. The moment I publish them for free, I immediately receive requests and the item is given away within a day or so. I've had folks driving for half an hour to pick up a bread knife that costs $13 on Amazon. It barely breaks even with the cost of th drive. 

Why do people do that? Is it the psychology of giveaways that affects their decision making? Or maybe there is a more altruistic motive such as reducing waste? Probably the former :)

Note: Facebook Marketplace is pretty awesome! I'm surprised anyone is still using Craigslist...
